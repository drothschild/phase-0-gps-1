## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The workflow was not automatic for me. I had success in using all of the commands prior to the session, but lacked the practice to know which command came next. I hadn't really used git fetch or git merge, only was exposed to it in the video.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The relevance of the git/GitHub workflow came to light because I was working with my pair. I just think it was easier to envision. The pushing process become more clarified to me as before I was not really sure what was going on with checkout between the branches and pulling from the origin master branch to make sure everything was up to date. It makes more sense now. It was also clearer to me how to delete the feature-branch locally.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
###Q: What is VIM?
  A: another text editor

###Q: How do you get the autofill suggestion when typing commands?
  A: press tab (They also taught me that I could press the up arrow to get go through previous commands)

###Q: (to pair) What resources are you using to help you right now?
  A: [Markdown1](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img) [Markdown2](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

###Q: (to guide) What could I do better next time?
  A: Talk through the directions even if you don't fully understand them instead of always trying to figure it out on your own first. Let it be messy and you and your pair can work together to figure it out.

## What still confuses you about git?
Using *git fetch origin* and *git merge origin master* are still not very clear to me. We used this instead of *pull*. I asked Emmanuel about it in office hours afterwards and he described that the *fetch/merge* commands are a replacement for *pull* and that *fetch/merge* is easer to debug, if needed, than *pull*. The other guide in office hours sent me this [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/what-are-the-differences-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch) to help. Cool!

I also asked Emmanuel about a conflict I was having when I tried to merge my repo to the master on GitHub last week. He sent me this [video](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/pull-request-wokflow-phase-0) which answered my question!

Awesome... I think I am correctly practicing my new markdown skill of adding links. *Fingers crossed!*

## How was your first experience of pairing in GPS?
It was a little rocky to start. I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. But now that it is over, I feel much more prepared and less anxious for next time. My pair was great to work with, he was patient and helpful on many occasions. I hope to work more quickly through the challenge next time. I started off as navigator and I think my slow digestion of what we were doing slowed us down. Our guide suggested that I speak through the directions/my thoughts out loud next time-- he said "let it be messy and work it out with your pair." Sweet!
