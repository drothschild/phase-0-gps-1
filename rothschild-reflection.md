## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I didn't have the workflow down yet.
## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Said workflow of changing a file and putting it in.
## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
You know, enough time's passed that I don't really remember well enough. I should fill this out earlier next time.
## What still confuses you about git?
I don't know enough about rolling back changes.
## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Actually it was a lot of fun. Relieved a lot of my doubts, made me realize I had concepts down.
